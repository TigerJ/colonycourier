<p>Welcome To Sunday Open Game DEV!</p>
<p>Every Sunday from 1pm until 4pm Eastern US time, I will be streaming raw game development video as we (you will be included in the process) make a 2d platform game in html5</p>
<p>You can email any assets you want to be included in the game to <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:jimmy.briggs.games@gmail.com" target="_blank">jimmy.briggs.games@gmail.com</a> or send me links on twitter <a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/stalkjimmy" target="_blank">@stalkjimmy</a></p>
<p>The current game we are working on will be available to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://devbriggs.com/cloudy/colonycourier/index_baked.html" target="_blank">play/test here</a></p>
<p>The current &quot;to do&quot; list of action items is publicly available <a rel="nofollow" href="https://trello.com/board/game-1/50f32be1a61fe98308003d00" target="_blank">as a Trello board Here</a></p>
<p>The source code for the game excluding our impactjs framework will be available on github here</p>
<p>note some of the dead links will be dead until I setup the proper locations for them to go to. Thanks for your patience</p>
